# DoE_PCA_example
This repository was created as part of the labs in the DoE course, hosted by the Computational Materials Chemistry group at Uppsala University (Teoroo-CMC).  It includes:

- a full factorial design of an experiment with two variables, model building, and optimization (Lab1).
- simple statistical analysis (t-test and ANOVA) of real data, principal component analysis, and model building through regression.
