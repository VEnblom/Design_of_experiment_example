# Design_of_experiment_example
This repository was created as part of the lab (week 2) in the DoE course, hosted by the Computational Materials Chemistry group at Uppsala University (Teoroo-CMC).  It includes a full factorial design of an experiment with two variables, model building, and optimization.
